## Project Overview
This project analyzes a dataset of customer subscriptions to identify key trends in customer segments, subscription duration, revenue, and cancellation patterns. 
Using Excel, SQL, and Power BI, this analysis provides insights into customer behavior 
and helps to identify areas for potential improvements in customer retention, revenue growth, and service offerings. 
The dataset includes customer information, subscription details, revenue, and cancellation statuses.

## Background
This dataset captures customer subscription information for a service provider, 
where each record corresponds to a unique customer and includes the following key fields:
- Customer ID and Name: Unique identifiers and names for each customer.
- Region: The geographical segment (North, South, East, West) of the customer.
- SubscriptionType: Type of subscription purchased by the customer.
- Subscription Dates: Start and end dates of each subscription.
- Canceled: Boolean indicating whether the subscription was canceled.
- Revenue: Revenue generated from each subscription.
- Subscription Duration: Length of the subscription period in days.

# The primary objectives of this analysis are to:
- Understand revenue patterns across customer segments.
- Identify cancellation trends and potential reasons for customer churn.
- Discover popular subscription types and average subscription duration.
- Provide stakeholders with actionable insights to optimize revenue and improve customer retention.

# Excel Analysis
### Purpose

# LITA-Capstone-Projects-2

## Project Overview
This project analyzes a dataset of customer subscriptions to identify key trends in customer segments, subscription duration, revenue, and cancellation patterns. 
Using Excel, SQL, and Power BI, this analysis provides insights into customer behavior 
and helps to identify areas for potential improvements in customer retention, revenue growth, and service offerings. 
The dataset includes customer information, subscription details, revenue, and cancellation statuses.

## Background
This dataset captures customer subscription information for a service provider, 
where each record corresponds to a unique customer and includes the following key fields:
- Customer ID and Name: Unique identifiers and names for each customer.
- Region: The geographical segment (North, South, East, West) of the customer.
- SubscriptionType: Type of subscription purchased by the customer.
- Subscription Dates: Start and end dates of each subscription.
- Canceled: Boolean indicating whether the subscription was canceled.
- Revenue: Revenue generated from each subscription.
- Subscription Duration: Length of the subscription period in days.

# The primary objectives of this analysis are to:
- Understand revenue patterns across customer segments.
- Identify cancellation trends and potential reasons for customer churn.
- Discover popular subscription types and average subscription duration.
- Provide stakeholders with actionable insights to optimize revenue and improve customer retention.

# Excel Analysis
### Purpose
Excel was used as an initial analysis tool to quickly organize, summarize, and 
metrics in the dataset. 
It serves as a flexible platform for data exploration and provides quick insights without requiring complex setup.

### Key Steps
- Analyze customer data using pivot tables to find subscription patterns.
- Calculate the average subscription duration and identify the most popular subscription types.

## Summary
Using Excel, I identified SubscriptionDuration for each, while Pivot tables revealed key customer segments and showed which subscription types are most popular.

# SQL Analysis
### Purpose 
SQL was used to query the data, aggregate results, and conduct deeper analysis. 
SQL queries provide precise and efficient ways to handle large datasets, automate calculations, and enable structured reporting.

### Key SQL Queries
- retrieve the total number of customers from each region.
- find the most popular subscription type by the number of customers.
- find customers who canceled their subscription within 6 months.
- calculate the average subscription duration for all customers.
-  find customers with subscriptions longer than 12 months.
- calculate total revenue by subscription type.
-  find the top 3 regions by subscription cancellations.
-  find the total number of active and canceled subscriptions
